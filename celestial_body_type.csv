1,Planet,Terrestrial,"Composed of silicate rocks and metals, with a solid surface."
2,Planet,Gas Giant,"Made of hydrogen and helium, like giant balls of gas. "
3,Planet,Ice Giant,"Composed of heavier elements like water, ammonia and methane."
4,Planet,Dwarf,Planets that orbit the sun but have not cleared the neighborhood around their orbit.
5,Moon,Regular,Moons that orbit in the same direction as the planet.
6,Moon ,Irregular,Moons with eccentric orbits. 
7,Star,Main Sequence,A star that is fusing hydrogen and helium in its core. 
8,Star,Red Giant,"An orange star where hydrogen fusion moves into the star's outer layers, causing them to expand."
9,Star,White Dwarf,"A star that has shed all its atmosphere, only its core remains. "
10,Star,Neutron Star ,"Stellar remnants, resulting from a supernova explosion. "
11,Star,Red Dwarf,Small main sequence stars. They are the coolest. 
12,Comet ,Periodic,Comets with orbits under 200 years. 
13,Comet ,Long-Period,Comets with orbits over 200 years.
14,Black Hole,Stellar-Mass,Formed from the collapse of massive stars. 
15,Black Hole,Intermediate-Mass,With masses between stellar and supermassive Black Holes. 
16,Black Hole,Supermassive ,Found at the center of most galaxies.
17,Nebula,Emission ,Formed of ionized gases that emit light of various wavelengths.
18,Nebula,Dark,"Molecular clouds that are so dense, they obscure the visible wavelengths of other objects behind them."
19,Nebula,Planetary,"An expanding, glowing shell of ionized gas ejected from red giant stars. "
20,Nebula,H II Region,A region of interstellar atomic hydrogen that is ionized. 
21,Quasar,Radio_Loud,Emit strong radio waves from powerful jets. 
22,Quasar,Radio_Quiet ,Quasars with a weaker radio emission. 
21,Star,Orange Dwarf,"A star that is smaller, cooler, and less luminous than our Sun but larger and hotter than a red dwarf."
22,Star,Subgiant,"A star that is brighter than a normal main-sequence star of the same spectral class, but not as bright as giant stars."
23,Star,Subdwarf,"A subdwarf is a class of star that is fainter than a star of the same spectral type on the main sequence, but which is brighter than a white dwarf of the same temperature."
24,Star,Brown Dwarf,"Substellar objects that have more mass than the biggest gas giant planets, but less than the least massive main-sequence stars."
25,Quasar,Microquasar,"A smaller version of a quasar, a compact region surrounding a stellar black hole with a mass several times that of its companion star, observable in sufficient detail, in our own or nearby galaxy."
26,Comet ,Interstellar,"A comet that, instead of originating from our solar system, comes from another star system. "
