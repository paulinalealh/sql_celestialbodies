# Celestial Bodies

In this project, I cleaned the data from celestial_bodies, ensuring there were no duplicates and standardizing sample sizes across categories. I removed irrelevant columns, renamed relevant ones, and standardized the dataset. For the Exploratory Data Analysis, I examined the general characteristics of the bodies, calculating measures such as mean, median, and mode, along with other statistical information.  

All the information in this project was obtained from the following sources:
